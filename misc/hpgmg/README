These are code snippets that Sam Williams sent.

exchange_boundary.c 
- threads across MPI msgs with serial computation

exchange_boundary_overlap.c 
- puts irecv, isend, wait in thread 0, computes in other threads

gsrb.vl.c
- stencil loop example that uses a 4th-order var coef like ours

From a second batch re: flux calculations, threaded, pipelined, omp4 simd,
alignment for intel compiler for Div-Flux type calculations:

files: residual.c operators.flux.c gsrb.c

macros are defined in operators.flux.c

residual/gsrb stream thru k calculating the fluxes in i and j as well as a new
flux in the k direction.  It also saves the old flux in the k direction
(flux_klo).  It then sums them up to calculate the laplacian.
