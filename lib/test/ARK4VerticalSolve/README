We're solving the 1D Helmholtz using ARK4.

The exact solution we want is:

\phi(x,y,z,t) = C * exp(-(\pi*k_x)^2 * \alpha * t) * cos(\pi*k_x*x)

One PDE this satisfies is:
\phi_t = c_I \phi_{xx} + c_E * \phi

where for any \beta in [0,1]
  c_I = \alpha \beta
  c_E  = - \alpha (pi*k_x)^2 * (1 - \beta)

Boundary conditions in x direction are homogeneous Neumann
