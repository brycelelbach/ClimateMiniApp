This is what I'm currently using for a test problem:

\begin{align*}
&U_t = k_xU_{xx} + k_yU_{yy} + k_zU_{zz} + h \quad x,y,z \in [0,1] &\\
&\\
&U(0,x,y) = 0 &\\
&U_t(t,0,y,z) = U_t(t,1,y,z) = 0 &\\
&U_t(t,x,0,z) = U_t(t,x,1,z) = 0 &\\
&U_t(t,x,y,0) = U_t(t,x,y,1) = 0 &\\
&&\\
&h(x,y,z) = \sin(A \pi x) \sin(B \pi y) \sin(C \pi z)&\\
&k_x(x,y,z) = \kappa_x, \; k_y(x,y,z) = \kappa_y, \; k_z(x,y,z) = \kappa_z& 
\end{align*}

This problem has an exact solution:

\begin{align*}
&U(t,x,y,z) = a(t) h(x,y,z) &\\
&a(t) = (1 - e^{(-Kt)}) / K &\\
&K = (A^2\kappa_x + B^2\kappa_y + C^2\kappa_z)\pi^2&
\end{align*}

This seemed nice for now, because we can make the diffusion coefficient in one
direction very small (relative to the other two directions). This gives us a
"vertical" direction with dynamics that evolve at a very different time scale
than the other two "horizontal" directions.

I don't know how well this will work for the cubed-sphere geometry, which I
haven't added in yet. I have variable diffusion coefficients in there, but I haven't tested
it yet with non-constant coefficients because I'm not sure how to formulate a test
problem with non-constant coefficients and an exact solution.

I'm using ARK4, but I am still doing lower order spatial operators, but I'm
going to add in the higher order spatial operators tonight/tomorrow. Everything
is still in unigrid (one LevelData).

I have a convergence test in there, but I'm not 100\% sure that it is implemented
correctly.
